# Node.js Express Server 500 Error on Response Delay

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express servers where a 500 error is returned when there's a delay in sending a response. The problem arises when asynchronous operations within request handlers take longer than anticipated and aren't handled correctly, leading to a response timeout.

## Bug Description
The provided Express.js server uses `setTimeout` to simulate an asynchronous operation.  If this operation takes longer than the server's implicit timeout, the client receives a 500 error rather than a response. This isn't always caught easily because Node.js doesn't explicitly tell you it timed out. 

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error handling and handling potential timeouts gracefully.  This might involve setting explicit timeouts using `res.setTimeout()`.
